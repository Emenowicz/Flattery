# Flattery

### Project Description
There are a lot of web services that allow for the user to add new housing offer in order to find a new tenant. 
It makes it difficult for people to find new house, flat or room.
Main effects of the problem are that people must search through every housing services by themselves.
There are so many of them which makes it difficult to find an interesting offer.
Solution to this problem is grouping offers in one place and display them to the user.
